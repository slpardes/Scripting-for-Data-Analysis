# Scripting for Data Analysis

The goal of this class was to learn about the tools and skills of scripting needed to solve problems of accessing and preparing data in a variety of formats and situations, or data wrangling. The scripting provided the skills needed to form data science pipelines, from acquiring and cleaning data to accessing data and transforming data for analysis
or visualization. The main content focused on information access and processing tasks on the types of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data obtained from spreadsheets, databases, HTML/XML web pages, and JSON from APIs. The scripting language for this course was Python.
